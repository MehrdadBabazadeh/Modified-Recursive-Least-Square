# Modified-Recursive-Least-Square
This is a SIMULINK tool that I have made for model identification of fast-varying systems.
A Youtube video about this system is in: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6h0aF6Tciw

Boost Your System Identification: A Comparative Analysis of RLS Algorithms. Discover how to accurately identify fast-changing systems in real-time. This video delves into the performance of classic RLS-based algorithms (FF, LMFF, KF, Gradient, Normalized Gradient) and introduces a novel Modified RLS (Mod-RLS) method. I demonstrate the superior performance of Mod-RLS using a simplified Li-ion battery model.
